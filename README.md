Invoice Important Data Extractor

An application that will read images (possibly PDF documents too) of invoices and will provide the user with the most important information (such as number, date, price, etc.) in an easily readable manner. Invoices differ greatly, every company can customize their own. For that reason it is sometimes time consuming to search for the information you need in all corners of the document. The application will hopefully get you rid of this trouble by making the data readily available in a format that remains unchanged.
Tesseract OCR likely to be used.
